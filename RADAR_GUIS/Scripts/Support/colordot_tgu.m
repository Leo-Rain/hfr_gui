function [dh,sh] = colordot( x, y, c, clim, pfunc, varargin )
%COLORDOT plots dots using colormap
%
% Usage: [dot_handles,surf_handle] = colordot(x,y,cval,clim,plot_func,...)
%
% where cval are the values to use for coloring the dots.  clim specify the
% limits of the color axis.  If not given or empty, clim defaults to the min
% and max of cval.  plot_func is the function to use for plotting the dots.
% This defaults to 'line' if empty or absent, but could alternatively be
% 'm_line'.
%
% ... are further arguments to the plot_func function.  If further
% arguments are used, then clim and plot_func must at least be given as
% empty arguments.
%
% dot_handles is a vector of handles to the dots in the plot.  Dot coloring
% will be done with the current colormap.  surf_handle is the handle to an
% invisible surface that is used to force the colorbar to have the
% appropriate scale and colors for the dots plotted.  This is an ugly trick
% to make colorbar agree with the dots plotted by this function.  Because
% this trick is used, changing the colormap will not change the
% color of the dots, as it only changes the color of surfaces.  Changing the
% color axis (caxis), will also have no effect on the dot colors.  This
% trick also means that one cannot combine colordot with a function that
% plots surfaces according to the current colormap.  The scatter function
% is a slow, but viable, alternative to this function that does not have
% these problems.

%SIMPLE FIX TO PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED FURTHER
%Problem: c < 0, this has happened on several data sets when 
%   plotting radial data coverages. When c < 0 this is not a valid
%   RGB-color value -- i.e. all values of c must be c >= 0 and c <= 1
%   Here's the simple fix that will work, but it's more of bandaid than
%   a fix
